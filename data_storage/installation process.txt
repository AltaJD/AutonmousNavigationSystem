Notes:
If you encounter an error about installing lxml, download the required lxml library from "https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml" and then run the following command:

For Python3.10: `pip install lxml‑4.9.0‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl`
For Python3.11: `pip install lxml-4.9.0-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl`


it was suggested to use python 3.8 instead to acquire correct lxml version:
